What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

With adaptive layouts,  
Design is often divided among desktop, tablet, or phone, Media queries are used,
Layout widths are still hard coded at each media query, and there is quick 
deployment for specific devices. 

With a responsive layout, Responsive layouts combine features of fixed, adaptive, and fluid websites 
together into one seamless experience. Media queries are used to constrain responsive units so that 
as the viewport expands or shrinks, you get an experience that looks and functions beautifully 
across thousands of devices and screen sizes.

Responsive sites take more time and effort to create and are the standard long term projects should aim for.



Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first?

Mobile first implies you will design and code for a mobile device first 
and expand layout or features as you gain more screen space toward desktop. 
Desktop first means you design only for the convenience of those on laptops/desktops.

What does font-size: 62.5% in the html tag do for us when using rem units?

The rem or root em unit is also referred to as a relative length unit. 
The root part means that this unit looks to the root element in a page. 
This is a great thing because now we can adjust our relative font-size off 
of one place instead of many like the em does. 

 With 62.5% as the base value, then you can convert rem units 
 by the power of 10 instead of 16. 62.5 * .16 = 10. 
 That means 1rem would equate to 10px throughout the document!

 How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?


Preprocessing extends the ability of CSS by adding abstractions and making
 CSS easier to use. For example, LESS is a language extension for CSS. 
 It fits nicely into almost every type of development stack and 
 has been ported to JavaScript among many other programming languages. 

What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

To be honest, preprocessing gave me a lot of trouble so I have no favorite concept.
What was most troublesome was installing it within the terminal as well as ensuring
it worked within the root project's folder.
